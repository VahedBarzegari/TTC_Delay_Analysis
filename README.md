🚇 Exploring a Decade of Transit Delays in Toronto 🚌🚋

I’ve developed an interactive Shiny for Python dashboard that analyzes TTC delay reports from 2014 to 2024 across Bus, Streetcar, and Subway modes.

With user-friendly filters, you can dive deep into incident types, delay durations, and impacted routes. 📊

🔍 Key Insights:

🚌 Bus

Most frequent incident type: Mechanical
Routes with the highest incidents in 2024: 32, 52, 96
75% of delays are under 18 minutes
🚋 Streetcar

Most frequent incident type: Operations
Routes with the highest incidents in 2024: 501, 504, 505
75% of delays are under 11 minutes
🚇 Subway

Most frequent incident type: Disorderly Patron
Most impacted route in 2024: Line 1
75% of delays are under 7 minutes
📌 General Observations

Bus network reports the highest number of incidents, while Subway sees the fewest but with more varied incident types.
Location data lacks coordinates, making spatial analysis difficult.
Data cleaning was a challenge due to typos and blank fields.
💡 This dashboard aims to support transit planners, policy makers, and anyone passionate about improving urban mobility.

🙏 Special thanks to TTC and the City of Toronto for openly publishing this valuable data.
